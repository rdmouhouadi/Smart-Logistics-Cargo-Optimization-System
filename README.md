# Smart-Logistics-Cargo-System

A sophisticated Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) based Smart Logistics Simulation System, originally developed as a school project. This system models real-world cargo management scenarios, incorporating weight and volume constraints, specialized container types, optimization algorithms, and automated reporting features.

## Roadmap

This project began as part of the Software Engineering course at Data ScienceTech Institute and has since evolved into a more advanced, feature-rich system. The primary goal is to document my learning journey in OOP while delivering a functional product with potential business applications.
